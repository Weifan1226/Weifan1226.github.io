Hi! I’m an undergraduate student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University (China). I’m currently working closely with [Prof. Bo Han](https://bhanml.github.io/) and [Dr. Zhenheng Tang](https://wizard1203.github.io/) on **trustworthy machine learning** and **LLM agent**.

📢 **I’m now looking for a Ph.D. position (2026 Fall)** 

If you are interested in my work or collaboration, please feel free to contact me.
